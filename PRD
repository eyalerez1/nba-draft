Build an application called **NBA Fantasy Auction Draft Assistant**.

**Context:**

* NBA Fantasy Draft using the **auction method** with a fixed **$200 budget**.
* The draft is live, with players nominated one at a time.
* Most participants are knowledgeable NBA fans, so the assistant should provide competitive insights.
* I will provide the complete player pool, including stats, positions, and projected auction values (e.g., imported from Yahoo or another site).
* The UI can be minimal—text-based or simple tables are fine.
* I prefer the app to be implemented in **Next.js**, but framework choice is not critical.

**Core Requirements:**

1. **Bidding Recommendations (when another player is nominated):**

   * Suggest whether I should bid.
   * Provide a recommended maximum bid value.
   * Consider:

     * My remaining budget.
     * My current roster needs (positions filled vs. open).
     * The player’s projected value relative to cost.
     * Tier/positional scarcity (e.g., if only a few elite PGs remain).
     * Opportunity cost of saving money for future players.

2. **Nomination Recommendations (when it’s my turn to nominate):**

   * Suggest the best player(s) to nominate.
   * Possible strategies to support:

     * Nominate a player I actually want to win.
     * Nominate a player I don’t want, to force others to spend money.
   * The app should recommend which approach makes sense given the stage of the draft and my roster/budget status.

3. **Draft Tracking:**

   * Keep track of:

     * My current roster (players, positions, salaries).
     * Remaining budget.
     * Which players have already been drafted (off the board).
   * Update recommendations dynamically as the draft progresses.

4. **AI-Powered Decision Logic:**

   * Use AI to analyze the player pool, my roster, and auction progress.
   * Factors AI should weigh:

     * Player value vs. cost efficiency.
     * Positional balance (avoiding gaps).
     * Roster construction strategy (e.g., stars + scrubs vs. balanced build).
     * Draft inflation/deflation trends (are players going over or under projected value?).
     * Remaining budget distribution across all teams (how much money other managers still have).

5. **Inputs & Outputs:**

   * **Inputs:**

     * Player list with stats and projected values (loaded manually by me).
     * Real-time updates of nominations, bids, and drafted players.
   * **Outputs:**

     * Bid/nomination recommendations (with reasoning, not just numbers).
     * Clear display of my roster, budget, and remaining needs.

**Goal:**
Create a tool that acts as a real-time strategy assistant during an NBA fantasy auction draft—helping me decide:

* Whether to bid and how much.
* Who to nominate and why.
* How to manage my budget and roster for maximum value.
